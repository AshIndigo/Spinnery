Spinnery is a modern, feature-complete GUI library for Minecraft 1.15.1, with a focus on making the GUI design and user experience significantly smoother and less nonsensic.

Currently, we have:

- All sorts of widgets; and creating new ones is trivial;
- JSON-driven themes, with support for custom ones and resource reloading;
- That wraps up a GUI library, I'm afraid?
